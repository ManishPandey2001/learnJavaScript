In the context of web development, window and document are two key objects in the browser's Document Object Model (DOM) that serve distinct purposes. Understanding their differences is crucial for effectively interacting with and manipulating web pages.

window Object
Global Object: The window object is the global object in the browser. All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
Represents Browser Window: It represents the entire browser window or tab, including the outer frame, and provides methods and properties to interact with the browser.
Global Scope: Variables declared with var outside of any function are added to the window object. Functions are also part of the global scope.
Common Properties and Methods
window.location: Provides information about the current URL and allows you to redirect the browser to a new URL.
window.alert(): Displays an alert dialog with the specified message.
window.setTimeout(), window.setInterval(): Schedule code to be executed after a specified delay or at specified intervals.
window.localStorage: Provides access to the browser's local storage.
window.history: Allows manipulation of the browser session history.
window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight: Dimensions of the viewport.

document Object
Part of the window Object: The document object is a property of the window object. It represents the web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point to the page's content.
DOM Representation: It represents the DOM and provides methods and properties for manipulating the HTML and CSS of the page.
Interface to HTML Content: The document object is used to access and manipulate elements within the HTML document.
Common Properties and Methods
document.getElementById(): Selects an element by its ID.
document.querySelector(), document.querySelectorAll(): Selects elements using CSS selectors.
document.createElement(): Creates a new HTML element.
document.body: Represents the <body> tag in the HTML document.
document.title: Gets or sets the title of the document.
document.addEventListener(): Attaches event listeners to the document.
Key Differences
Scope and Representation:

window: Represents the entire browser window, including all the browser's functionalities and user interface elements.
document: Represents the content of the web page, providing an interface for accessing and modifying the HTML and CSS.
Usage:

window: Used for browser-level manipulations such as controlling the window size, handling session storage, navigating between pages, etc.
document: Used for page-level manipulations such as accessing and changing elements, handling events within the page, and updating the content dynamically.
Global Context:

window: Acts as the global execution context. All global variables and functions are properties of the window object.
document: Exists within the window context and provides the entry point to the DOM.
