You can detect whether the Caps Lock key is on or off in JavaScript using the `getModifierState()` method within a keyboard event handler. Here's how:
**Explanation:**

1. **Event Listener:** We attach an event listener to the input field (`keyup`). This means the code inside the listener function will run whenever the user releases a key while focused on the input field.
2. **`getModifierState("CapsLock")`:** This method checks the state of the "CapsLock" modifier key during the keyup event. It returns `true` if Caps Lock is on and `false` if it's off.
3. **Conditional Logic:** We use an `if` statement to determine whether Caps Lock is on or off based on the result of `getModifierState()`. Inside the `if` and `else` blocks, you can add code to handle each case.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Browser Compatibility:** The `getModifierState()` method is widely supported by modern browsers. You can check browser compatibility tables if you need to support older browsers.
* **Event Types:** You can use the `keydown` event instead of `keyup` if you want to detect the Caps Lock state immediately when the key is pressed down.
* **Alternative:** In some cases, you might also be able to infer Caps Lock status by checking if all typed characters are uppercase and the Shift key is not pressed. However, this is less reliable than using `getModifierState()`.
* **Accessibility:** If you are displaying a warning to the user, ensure it is accessible to users with screen readers or other assistive technologies.
