In JavaScript, `void 0` (or `void(0)`) is used primarily for two purposes:

**1. Preventing Default Behavior:**

* **In Links (`<a>` tags):** When you want a link to execute JavaScript code without navigating to another page or refreshing the current one, you can set its `href` attribute to `javascript:void(0);`. The `void` operator ensures that the expression (in this case, `0`) is evaluated and its result (`undefined`) is discarded, thus preventing any default link action.

```html
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="myFunction();">Click Me</a>
```

* **In Event Handlers (`onclick`, etc.):**  Sometimes, you might have an event handler that doesn't need to return a value, but you still want to prevent any default behavior associated with the event. In this case, returning `void 0;` from the handler is equivalent to returning `undefined`, which is a falsy value that won't trigger any default actions.

```javascript
<button onclick="doSomething(); return void 0;">Click Me</button>
```

**2. Obtaining the `undefined` Value:**

* The `void` operator always returns `undefined` regardless of the expression it operates on. While you can simply write `undefined`, some developers prefer `void 0` for a few reasons:
    * **Minification:**  Minifiers might replace `undefined` with shorter alternatives, but they usually leave `void 0` untouched.
    * **Style:**  Some consider `void 0` to be more explicit about the intent to get the `undefined` value.
    * **Compatibility:** In very old JavaScript engines (pre-ES5), the `undefined` variable could be reassigned, but `void 0` always guaranteed the actual `undefined` value. 

```javascript
let x = void 0; // Equivalent to let x = undefined;
```

**Important Note:**

While `void 0` can be helpful, its usage in links should be minimized. It's generally considered better practice to use a `<button>` element with an `onclick` handler for actions that don't involve navigation, as this is more semantically correct and accessible for users with screen readers and assistive technologies.
