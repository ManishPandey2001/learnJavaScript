 * Absolutely! Let's break down how to perform these string and object operations in JavaScript without code examples:

**133. How to Check if a String Starts with Another String**

Think of a string as a sequence of characters. You can imagine it as a line of words in a sentence.  To see if one string starts with another, you're essentially checking if the initial characters of the first string perfectly match the entire second string you're looking for. 

There are two main ways to do this:

- **Dedicated Method:** JavaScript has a built-in tool, like a specialized magnifying glass, designed precisely for this task. You simply provide it with the string you're searching for, and it will quickly tell you "yes" or "no" based on whether the first string begins with the given substring.

- **Index-Based Check:** You can also manually check the position of the substring you're looking for within the larger string. If it's found right at the very beginning (position 0), then you know the string starts with that substring.


**134. How to Trim a String**

Trimming a string is like removing any extra spaces (or other specified characters) from the beginning and/or end, much like you might trim the edges of a piece of paper.  JavaScript has a built-in tool that acts like a pair of scissors for this task, allowing you to easily remove unwanted characters from both sides of the string.

**135. How to Add a Key-Value Pair**

In JavaScript, objects are like containers that hold information in the form of key-value pairs. Each key is a label or name (like a drawer in a filing cabinet), and the value is the data associated with that key (like the papers you put inside the drawer). 

To add a new key-value pair, you simply assign a value to a new key within the object, similar to how you'd label a new drawer and put something in it. If you want to avoid modifying the original object, you can create a new object by combining the existing object's properties with the new key-value pair. 

I hope these explanations are clear and helpful! Let me know if you'd like any of these concepts elaborated further.
