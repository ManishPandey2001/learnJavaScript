ECMAScript (often abbreviated as ES) is a standardized scripting language specification developed by Ecma International. It serves as the foundation for several popular scripting languages, most notably JavaScript.

**Purpose:**

The primary purpose of ECMAScript is to ensure interoperability among different web browsers and environments that support scripting languages. It defines:

- **Syntax:** The rules for writing valid code, including keywords, operators, expressions, and statements.
- **Semantics:** The meaning of the code, how it should be interpreted and executed.
- **Standard Library:** A set of built-in objects and functions that provide essential functionalities like data types (arrays, objects), functions, and regular expressions.

**Relationship with JavaScript:**

While ECMAScript provides the underlying language specification, JavaScript is the most common implementation of it. You can think of ECMAScript as the blueprint, and JavaScript as the actual building constructed based on that blueprint. However, JavaScript often extends beyond the standard by adding browser-specific features or other enhancements.

**Evolving Standard:**

The ECMAScript standard is constantly evolving. New versions (ES6, ES7, ES8, and so on) are released periodically to introduce new features, improve performance, and address shortcomings. Each new version builds upon the previous one, making JavaScript a more powerful and versatile language.

**Examples of ECMAScript Features:**

- **Data Types:** Numbers, strings, Booleans, objects, arrays, etc.
- **Control Flow:** `if` statements, loops (`for`, `while`), `switch` statements.
- **Functions:** Defining, calling, and using functions.
- **Classes:** Defining classes and creating objects.
- **Modules:** Organizing code into reusable modules.
- **Promises:** Handling asynchronous operations.
- **Arrow Functions:** A more concise way of writing functions.
- **Template Literals:** A way to embed expressions in strings.
