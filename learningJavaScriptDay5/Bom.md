The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a browser-specific model that allows JavaScript to interact with the browser window and its components.

**Main Objects:**

- `window`: The global object representing the browser window or tab. It provides properties and methods for interacting with the window, controlling navigation, and accessing other BOM objects.
- `document`: Represents the HTML document loaded in the window and is the root of the DOM. While technically part of the DOM, it's often considered part of the BOM due to its close relationship with the window.
- `history`: Provides access to the browser's session history (visited pages).
- `navigator`: Contains information about the browser and its capabilities.
- `screen`: Provides information about the screen's dimensions and color depth.
- `location`: Represents the current URL of the document and allows you to manipulate it.

**Main Methods (of the `window` object):**

- `alert()`: Displays an alert dialog box with a message.
- `confirm()`: Displays a confirmation dialog box with a message and OK/Cancel buttons.
- `prompt()`: Displays a prompt dialog box with a message and an input field.
- `open()`: Opens a new browser window or tab.
- `close()`: Closes the current window or tab.
- `setTimeout()`: Executes a function or code snippet after a specified delay.
- `setInterval()`: Repeatedly executes a function or code snippet with a fixed time delay between each call.

Note:  The BOM is not an official standard, so its implementation might vary slightly between different browsers.
