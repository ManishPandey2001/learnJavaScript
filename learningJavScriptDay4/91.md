In JavaScript, objects can be classified into three main categories:

**1. Native Objects:**

* **Origin:** Defined by the ECMAScript standard, the core language specification for JavaScript.
* **Examples:** `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Object`, `Array`, `Date`, `Math`, `RegExp`, `Function`, `Error`, etc.
* **Availability:** These are built-in and always available in any JavaScript environment (browser or Node.js).

**2. Host Objects:**

* **Origin:** Provided by the runtime environment where the JavaScript code is executed.
* **Browser Environment Examples:** `window`, `document`, `location`, `history`, `navigator`, `XMLHttpRequest`, etc.
* **Node.js Environment Examples:** `process`, `global`, `require`, `module`, etc.
* **Availability:** These objects vary depending on the environment (browser, Node.js, etc.) and might not be available in all contexts.

**3. User Objects:**

* **Origin:** Created by you, the developer, in your own JavaScript code.
* **Examples:** Objects created using object literals (`{}`), constructor functions (`new MyClass()`), or class syntax (`class Person { ... }`).
* **Availability:** These objects exist only within the scope of your code and are not provided by the language or environment.

**Key Differences in a Table:**

| Feature        | Native Objects                   | Host Objects                                               | User Objects              |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Defined by     | ECMAScript standard               | Runtime environment (browser, Node.js)                    | Developer's code          |
| Examples       | `String`, `Array`, `Math`         | `window`, `document`, `console` (browser), `process` (Node.js) | Any object you create |
| Availability   | Always available in JavaScript    | Depends on the environment                                  | Only in your code's scope  |

**Additional Notes:**

* **Hybrid Objects:** Some objects, like `Date`, are considered both native and built-in, as they are defined in the standard but also have some host-specific extensions in browsers.
* **Inheritance:** User objects often inherit from native objects, allowing you to extend and customize their behavior.
* **Importance of Understanding:** Understanding the differences between these object types is crucial for debugging, compatibility, and avoiding errors in your JavaScript code.
