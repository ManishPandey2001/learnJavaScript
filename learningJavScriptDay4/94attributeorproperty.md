Key Differences
Initialization vs. State:

Attributes are used to initialize properties and reflect the original HTML values.
Properties reflect the current state of the element and can change dynamically.
Static vs. Dynamic:

Attributes remain static unless modified programmatically.
Properties are dynamic and can be changed by user interactions or JavaScript.
Methods of Access:

Attributes are accessed using getAttribute() and setAttribute().
Properties are accessed directly using dot notation (e.g., element.propertyName).
