Both `load` and `DOMContentLoaded` events signal that a web page has finished loading, but they are triggered at different stages of the loading process. The key difference lies in what they consider "loaded":

**DOMContentLoaded Event:**

* **Triggered when:** The initial HTML document has been fully parsed and the DOM tree is constructed, but external resources like images, stylesheets, and subframes might not have finished loading yet.
* **Focus:** This event focuses on the structure of the page being ready for JavaScript manipulation.
* **Use case:** Ideal for tasks that need to interact with the DOM early, such as setting up event listeners, modifying element styles, or initializing content that doesn't depend on external resources.

**Load Event:**

* **Triggered when:** The entire page, including all dependent resources like images, stylesheets, scripts, and subframes, has finished loading.
* **Focus:** This event signals that all resources are fully available and ready to use.
* **Use case:** Suited for tasks that depend on the dimensions of images or the execution of scripts that might manipulate the DOM after the initial loading.

**Example:**

```javascript
// DOMContentLoaded event handler
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
    console.log('DOM fully loaded and parsed');
    // Access and manipulate DOM elements here
});

// Load event handler
window.addEventListener('load', (event) => {
    console.log('Page and all resources fully loaded');
    // Perform actions that depend on external resources
});
```

**Summary:**

| Event               | Triggered When                                                                         | Use Case                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DOMContentLoaded` | Initial HTML document is parsed and DOM tree is built (scripts, styles, images might still load) | Interact with DOM early, set up event listeners, initialize content that doesn't depend on external resources                   |
| `load`             | Entire page and all resources are fully loaded                                          | Perform actions that rely on external resources (images, stylesheets, scripts) being loaded and available, e.g., animations, calculations |

**Choosing the Right Event:**

* Use `DOMContentLoaded` when you want to start interacting with the DOM as soon as possible.
* Use `load` when your code depends on elements that might not be fully available until all resources have finished loading.
