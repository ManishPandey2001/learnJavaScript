Web storage can be accessed using JavaScript through two objects:

localStorage: Stores data with no expiration date. The data persists even after the browser is closed.

sessionStorage: Stores data for a session. The data is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed.

Both objects share the same methods for accessing and managing data:

Methods:

setItem(key, value): Stores a key-value pair in the storage.
getItem(key): Retrieves the value associated with the given key.
removeItem(key): Removes the key-value pair with the given key.
clear(): Removes all key-value pairs from the storage.
key(index): Returns the key at the specified index.
length: Returns the number of items in the storage.

Important Considerations:

Web storage has a storage limit (usually around 5MB).
Data is stored as strings. You may need to parse values when retrieving them (e.g., JSON.parse() for JSON data).
Consider security implications when storing sensitive data.

What is a storage event and its event handler
A storage event is a type of event in JavaScript that is triggered when a storage area (either localStorage or sessionStorage) is modified in the context of another document, meaning in a different tab or window within the same domain. This event is not triggered when changes are made within the same tab or window.

Event Handler:

The storage event can be handled using an event listener on the window object:
