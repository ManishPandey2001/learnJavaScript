**Why Do You Need Web Storage?**

Web storage (localStorage and sessionStorage) provides a way to store data directly in the user's browser. This offers several benefits over traditional methods like cookies:

* **More Storage:** Web storage typically allows for more data storage than cookies (usually around 5MB per domain).
* **Client-Side Management:** Data in web storage is managed entirely on the client-side, reducing the need to send data back and forth to the server with every request.
* **Improved Performance:** Since web storage data is stored locally, it can be accessed and modified quickly, leading to faster page loads and smoother user interactions.
* **Persistence or Session-Based:** You have the choice between persistent storage (localStorage, which survives browser closures) or session-based storage (sessionStorage, which is cleared when the session ends).
* **User Preferences and State:** Web storage is ideal for storing user preferences, UI state, and other information that needs to be remembered between page views or even after the browser is closed.

**47. How do you check web storage browser support?**

You can use a simple feature detection technique:

```javascript
if (typeof(Storage) !== "undefined") {
  // Web storage is supported! (localStorage and sessionStorage)
  // ... your code to use web storage here
} else {
  // Web storage is not supported.
  // ... provide fallback or alternative behavior
}
```


**48. How do you check web workers browser support?**

Similar to web storage, you can use feature detection to check for web worker support:

```javascript
if (window.Worker) {
  // Web Workers are supported!
  // ... your code to use web workers here
} else {
  // Web Workers are not supported.
  // ... provide fallback or alternative behavior
}
```


**49. Give an example of a web worker:**

Here's a basic example of a web worker that calculates Fibonacci numbers:

```javascript
// main.js (main thread)
const worker = new Worker('fibonacci_worker.js');

worker.postMessage(10); // Send a number to the worker

worker.onmessage = function(e) {
  console.log('Fibonacci result:', e.data);
};

// fibonacci_worker.js (web worker thread)
self.onmessage = function(e) {
  const result = fibonacci(e.data);
  postMessage(result);
};

function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

**50. What are the restrictions of web workers on DOM?**

Web workers operate in a separate thread from the main browser thread, so they have the following restrictions when it comes to the DOM:

* **No Direct DOM Access:** Web workers cannot directly access or manipulate the DOM. This is to prevent race conditions and other synchronization issues.
* **Communication Through Messages:** Communication between the web worker and the main thread happens through message passing (using `postMessage` and `onmessage`).
* **Limited Window Object Access:** Web workers have a limited view of the `window` object. They have their own global scope (`self`) and cannot directly access properties like `window.location` or `window.document`.
* **Same-Origin Policy:** Web workers are subject to the same-origin policy, meaning they can only load scripts and access resources from the same origin as the parent page.
