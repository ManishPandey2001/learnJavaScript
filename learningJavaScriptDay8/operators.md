JavaScript supports a wide range of operators for various tasks, including mathematical calculations, comparisons, logical operations, and more. Here's a breakdown of the main categories:

**1. Arithmetic Operators:**

* `+` (Addition)
* `-` (Subtraction)
* `*` (Multiplication)
* `/` (Division)
* `%` (Modulus - remainder after division)
* `**` (Exponentiation)
* `++` (Increment)
* `--` (Decrement)

**2. Assignment Operators:**

* `=` (Assignment)
* `+=` (Add and assign)
* `-=` (Subtract and assign)
* `*=` (Multiply and assign)
* `/=` (Divide and assign)
* `%=` (Modulus and assign)
* `**=` (Exponentiation and assign)

**3. Comparison Operators:**

* `==` (Equal to)
* `!=` (Not equal to)
* `===` (Strict equal to - checks value and type)
* `!==` (Strict not equal to)
* `>` (Greater than)
* `<` (Less than)
* `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
* `<=` (Less than or equal to)

**4. Logical Operators:**

* `&&` (Logical AND)
* `||` (Logical OR)
* `!` (Logical NOT)

**5. Bitwise Operators:**

* `&` (Bitwise AND)
* `|` (Bitwise OR)
* `^` (Bitwise XOR)
* `~` (Bitwise NOT)
* `<<` (Left shift)
* `>>` (Right shift)
* `>>>` (Unsigned right shift)

**6. String Operators:**

* `+` (Concatenation)
* `+=` (Concatenate and assign)
* `.` (Access properties of strings)
* `[]` (Access characters in a string)

**7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator:**

* `? :` (Evaluates a condition and returns one of two expressions)

**8. Type Operators:**

* `typeof` (Returns the data type of a variable)
* `instanceof` (Checks if an object is an instance of a specific class)

**9. Other Operators:**

* `,` (Comma operator - evaluates multiple expressions and returns the last one)
* `delete` (Deletes a property from an object)
* `in` (Checks if a property exists in an object)
* `void` (Evaluates an expression and returns `undefined`)
