181. **How do you detect a browser language preference?**

You can use the `navigator.languages` property in JavaScript to detect a user's browser language preferences. It returns an array of language tags representing the user's preferred languages, ordered by preference.

```javascript
const userLanguages = navigator.languages;
console.log(userLanguages); // Output might be: ['en-US', 'en']
```

You can also use `navigator.language`, which typically returns the first element of the `navigator.languages` array (the user's most preferred language).

```javascript
const mostPreferredLanguage = navigator.language;
console.log(mostPreferredLanguage); // Output might be: 'en-US'
```

**183. How do you detect JavaScript disabled in the page?**

You can use a simple `<noscript>` tag within your HTML to detect if JavaScript is disabled:

```html
<noscript>
  <div class="js-disabled">
    JavaScript is disabled. Please enable it for full functionality.
  </div>
</noscript>
```

The content within the `<noscript>` tag will only be displayed if JavaScript is not enabled in the browser. You can use CSS to style the `.js-disabled` element to provide a visual indicator to the user.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Progressive Enhancement:** It's a good practice to build your website to function without JavaScript as a baseline (e.g., basic content is still accessible). Then, use JavaScript to enhance the experience (e.g., interactive elements).
- **Server-Side Detection:** If you need to detect JavaScript on the server-side (e.g., for analytics), you can check the `User-Agent` header to see if it includes JavaScript-related information. However, this is not a foolproof method, as users can modify their browser headers.
