In JavaScript, the global execution context (GEC) is the environment in which your JavaScript code starts running when a script is first loaded and executed. It's the base execution context that all your code resides in unless it's inside a function.

**Key Points about the Global Execution Context:**

* **Creation:** The GEC is created before any of your code is executed.
* **Singularity:** There is only one global execution context per JavaScript program.
* **Global Object:** The GEC contains a global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js) that acts as a container for global variables and functions.
* **'this' Binding:** In the GEC, the `this` keyword refers to the global object.
* **Hoisting:** Variable and function declarations are hoisted to the top of the GEC, meaning you can use them before they are declared in your code.

**Two Phases of GEC Creation:**

1. **Creation Phase:**
   - **Global Object Creation:** The global object (`window` or `global`) is created.
   - **Memory Allocation:** Memory is allocated for variables and functions.
   - **Variable Initialization:** Variables are declared and assigned a default value of `undefined`.
   - **Function References:** Functions are stored in memory with a reference to their code.

2. **Execution Phase:**
   - **Code Execution:** Your JavaScript code is executed line by line.
   - **Variable Assignment:** Variables are assigned their actual values.
   - **Function Invocation:** Functions are called, creating new execution contexts (function execution contexts).

**Example:**

```javascript
// Global Execution Context

var globalVariable = 10; // Variable declaration and assignment
function globalFunction() {
  // ...function code...
}

console.log(globalVariable); // Output: 10 (global variable accessible)
globalFunction(); // Calling a global function
```

In this example:

- `globalVariable` is declared and assigned a value in the GEC.
- `globalFunction` is defined in the GEC.
- Both can be accessed and used anywhere in the script.

**Function Execution Contexts (FECs):**

Each time a function is called, a new execution context is created for that function. This FEC is similar to the GEC but has its own scope and `this` binding.

**Call Stack:**

The JavaScript engine uses a call stack to manage multiple execution contexts. The GEC is at the bottom, and FECs are pushed on top as functions are called. When a function finishes executing, its FEC is popped off the stack.

Understanding the global execution context and how it interacts with function execution contexts is crucial for grasping the inner workings of JavaScript and avoiding common pitfalls related to scoping and variable behavior.
